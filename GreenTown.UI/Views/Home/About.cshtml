		<div class="story">
			<p>Cottage community Green Hills is the first American town in Ukraine with fully operating social and engineering infrastructure created by British developer Dragon-Ukrainian Properties & Development. 
            The town is located in a green area near the village of Vita-Poshtova, 10 km apart from Kiev. It is surrounded by beautiful forest and three lakes. Joint barbecue with neighbors on weekends and family celebrations in warm and friendly atmosphere – that's what makes life here unique. A high level of comfort and service will make you forget about all daily 
            problems.
